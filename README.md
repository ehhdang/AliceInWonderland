## Description
Children who come from challenged backgrounds lack the support needed to develop strong reading skills. Students with poor reading skills fail to reach their potential in school and life, increasing the likelihood of problems like substance abuse and criminal behavior. This application should mitigate the lack of academic support these students receive by strengthening their reading skills, consequently enabling them to succeed academically and in life. Our product will be a web-based app compatible with iOS and Android mobile devices that teaches children how to read using the Alice in Wonderland story.
